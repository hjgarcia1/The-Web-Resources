#The Web Resources


I have learned so mush over the last few years and have collected so many links I would like to share them with the Web Community.

I am by no means a top-notch developer but I have written a few apps which many Teachers and Students in Science and Math use today.  Over the past four years I have had the opportunity to learn from the great minds in the Web Community like Taylor Otwell, Jeffrey Way, and many others.  I hope to be able to give something back to the Web World by adding my own list of resources and the long list of resources can help no matter what stage of development your are in.

Feel free to ask me any questions or make suggestions regarding anything on this repo on twitter: **@hjgarcia1**.

##The tools of the trade (for me at least)
___
*	I use a MacBook Pro (nothing against Windows or Linux - I am also a computer nerd)
*	[PHPStorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/)
*	[MAMP Pro - OSX](http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html)
*	[ITerm2 - OSX](http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home)
*	[CodeKit - OSX](http://incident57.com/codekit/)
*	[Git-Tower - OSX](http://www.git-tower.com/)
*	[Sequel Pro - OSX](http://www.sequelpro.com/)
*	[Mou Markdown Editor - OSX](http://mouapp.com/)
*	[LiveReload](http://livereload.com/) 

(I will be adding Windows stuff in the near future. Once I get a chance to test it out, and make sure it can help.)

####Useful tips for PHPStorm users:

*	I use CodeKit for LESS, SCSS compilation and minification as well as JS concatenation and minification therefore I don't use the [FileWatcher Plugin](http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7177?pr=idea).

*	Good Collection of Themes @ [http://www.phpstorm-themes.com/](http://www.phpstorm-themes.com/).

*	PHPStorm comes with git and database navigation built it.  You don't really need Tower and Sequel Pro. Having does not hurt though.

*	Source Code Pro Font does work: For anyone on OSX trying to get this combination to work, you'll have to add in the SCP .ttf files to this folder : /System/Library/JavaVM.Framework/Home/lib/fonts

*	Useful Plugins are:
	[AceJump](http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7086?pr=phpStorm)
	
*	Some useful tutorials:
 	[Jetbrains TV](http://tv.jetbrains.net/channel/phpstorm),
  	[John Lindquist - Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/user/johnlindquist/videos),
  	[Fedor Korotkov - Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6tN3HRJtnUhTyRvQB24O1g/videos)
  	
*	Use [Live Templates](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTOmzN_sNgU). Makes for faster editing.
 
##And here comes the Learning
___

*Anything that requires a subscription I will add a $ sign next to it as a heads up.  I will try to keep adding as many free resources as I can.*
